🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in C

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game built using the C programming language. This project was developed as part of my learning journey as a Computer Science student at Bina Nusantara University.
The game supports Player vs Player mode and showcases modular programming, game logic, and clean board display updates.

- ✅ 3x3 game board
- 👤 Player vs Player (turn-based)
- 🧠 Win and draw condition detection
- 🔁 Option to replay the game
- 🧼 Clean board refresh using `system("cls")` (Windows)
